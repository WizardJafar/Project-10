                <p class="jafar">HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is a markup language for the web that defines the structure of
                    web pages. It is one of the most basic building blocks of every website, so it's crucial to learn if
                    you want to have a career in web development</p>

                    styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such
                    as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and

                    for game development, and lots more. It allows you to implement dynamic features on web pages that

                <p class="bum" >jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library. The purpose of jQuery is to make
                    it much easier to use JavaScript on your website. jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require
                    many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a
                    single line of code.

                    Node is used extensively for server-side programming, making it possible for developers to use
                    JavaScript for client-side and server-side code without needing to learn an additional language.

                    language and lets you extend HTML's syntax to express your application's components clearly and
                    succinctly. AngularJS's data binding and dependency injection eliminate much of the code you would
                    otherwise have to write.
